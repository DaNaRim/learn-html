    The words ha and haa are grouped below. The first group is used by writing \1 to avoid rewriting.

    You can group an expression and ensure that it is not captured by references. For example, below are two groups.

    It allows to specify that an expression can be in different expressions.
    Thus, all possible statements are written separated by the pipe sign |.
    This differs from charset [abc], charsets operate at the character level. Alternatives are at the expression level.
    For example, the following expression would select both cat and Cat.
    Add another pipe sign | to the end of the expression and type rat so that all words are selected.

    Regex does a greedy match by default. This means that the matchmaking will be as long as possible.
    Check out the example below. It refers to any match that ends in r and can be any character preceded by it.

    Lazy matchmaking, unlike greedy matching, stops at the first matching.
    For example, in the example below, add a ? after * to find the first match that ends with the letter r and is
    preceded by any character. It means that this match will stop at the first letter r.
