<h1>Important notice</h1>
<p>
    On
    <strong>Sunday January 9th 2010</strong>
    , a gang of
    <em>goths</em>
    were spotted stealing
    <strong>
        <em>several</em>
        garden gnomes
    </strong>
    from a shopping center in downtown
    <strong>Milwaukee</strong>
    . They were all wearing
    <em>green jumpsuits</em>
    and
    <em>silly hats</em>
    , and seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone has
    <strong>any</strong>
    information about this incident, please contact the police
    <strong>now</strong>
    .
