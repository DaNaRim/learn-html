<!--<main>      is for content unique to this page. Use <main> only once per page, and put it directly inside <body>.
                    Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.-->
<!--<article>   encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page
                    (e.g., a single blog post).-->
<!--<section>   is similar to <article>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes
                    one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries),
                    or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you
                    can break <article>s up into different <section>s, or <section>s up into different <article>s,
                    depending on the context.-->
<!--<aside>     contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information
                    indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).-->
<!--<header>    represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of <body> it defines the global header of a
                    webpage, but if it's a child of an <article> or <section> it defines a specific header for that
                    section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).-->
<!--<nav>       contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the
                    navigation.-->
<!--<footer>    represents a group of end content for a page.-->

    There once was a man named O'Dell<br>
    Who loved to write HTML<br>
    But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br>
    and his markup didn't read very well.

    Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding
    netherbeasts. Scared, but determined to protect his friends, he raised his
    wand and prepared to do battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.

    Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement
    and pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted
    distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it
    hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
